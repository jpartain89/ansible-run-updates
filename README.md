# Ansible Run Updates

This repo is so I have my Ansible Stuff separated out for easier access to be able to run system updates.

## Breakdown

I have the `group_vars` directory, `ansible.cfg` and `hosts` files in the top most directory because those take precedent over any other files of the same found anywhere else on your machine. This way, I can have specific, restricted settings for my repo. Plus, its less messy for something simple.
